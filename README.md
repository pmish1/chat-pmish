Web based chat app where once users have made an account, they are able to send text/image based messages in realtime, as well as search/add friends. 

TECH STACK:
- ReactJS (with ContextAPI) and CSS for front end
- GoogleAuth for authentication 
- Firebase for database management and website hosting


- Working on:
    + after registering new user, home page needs refresh to show profile image and name
    + I was not able to consistenly replicate this, however, a previously logged-in user's chats can appear if a new user logs in
